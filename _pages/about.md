I’m Yulun (Ben) Wu, a second-year M.S. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UIUC focusing on machine learning for audio and spatial signal processing. I'm currently working in [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) lab, advised by [Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/). My recent work spans multi-channel speech dereverberation with diffusion posterior sampling, spatial audio coding, and subspace beamforming, and I serve as a Graduate TA for ECE 310 (Digital Signal Processing). Previously, I interned at Sony’s Audio Product Design group in Tokyo, where I developed and evaluated ANC algorithms for the WH-1000XM5 series. I enjoy building end-to-end systems that marry careful DSP with modern generative models. 


Outside the lab, music is a huge part of my life. I minored in music as an undergrad and spent four years as the lead guitarist in a rock band starting in high school. The love of music is my inspiration and motivation to dedicate to the audio speech research. My favoriate artists are J.Cole and Pink Floyd.
